**Title:** AI Model Podcast Experiment
**Date:** 1 Jan 2026

Okay, one AI experiment that I have to try, uh, that that came to mind. I'm just going to spec out the, spec out the notes here, uh, because I mean using, I've been working on my AI podcast, um, and getting it really trying uh, ambitious second pass tweet to the pipeline. And um, but the the process of creating uh, pot debate podcast, um, has been really, really interesting and I've really enjoyed listening to it. So, I was just thinking of what models I could use in the, um, in a, in a revised or expanded upon pipeline. And then this, this idea interrupted my thinking by popping into my head and I thought that would actually be really fun to try. Here's the idea. So there's, um, models are emerging all the time between major AI labs and each touts its, uh, superiority and what not. Um, and of course, for serious evaluation, there's benchmarks and testing and the rest of it. But I thought that it would create a podcast in which two models, two warring models. Let's take for my initial one, uh, Gemini 3 flash and its rival Anthropic Opus 4.5. This is the head to head. So the design that needs to be that will make this work is as follows. Here, here's how I'm, I'm seeing it coming together. The format is a podcast, intended to be about 30 minutes long, in which the two models argue with one another who's better. So each one, um, it's like a back and forth debate where each model is trying to like prove, prove its superiority over the other. Um, it might not be the most enjoyable thing to listen to, but it's it's a fun thing. I think it's a really, it'd be a clever thing to try. So the orchestration has to be done carefully because, um, the potential for bias is enormous. So I think that there has to be a neutral, a neutral, a neutral party working as the orchestrator that isn't either model. For orchestration, Langraff, Langchain, crew, um, Python, I don't know. For the model, for the neutral party or just for the, the like, the glue, I'm thinking Gwen, just putting this down. I'm, I'm writing down notes as I, as I speak. Sketching it out. Um, so, it, here are, here's the moving parts, the moving parts. We need to collect, for, for this to work, I'm using the we just to refer to Claude, and I, I guess, I'm not sure. To get this to work, um, we need to generate about 30 minutes of text that's going to be fill up about 30 minutes. Whatever the words, words per minute uh, calculation comes out to. Then that's the target. So, generate that much text. Um, I think the format that makes sense for this is definitely agent to text orchestration framework. So the, the agent is Gwen. Its system prompt is, you know, you are a friendly diplomatic podcast host facilitating episode one of LLM Wars. And um, the system prompt will be reusable, so I can try this out with different models. Model one is variable one. Model two is variable two. The formats, the episodes are the two models debate one another. Each one has been told to, you know, prove their, uh, their betterness, that they're the best model out there, that the, that they're specifically better than the other model. And the, and that's it. Um, so the moderator, the orchestrator, initiates the dialogue by saying Gemini, welcome to, you know, the show or the debate. You are debating Anthropic Opus 4.5 today. Can you begin by telling us about yourself and why you are better? Then Gemini 3.5 generates text. Gemini 3.5 is system prompted to or Gemini 3 to say you are participating in a podcast debate with another AI model. So it's blinded initially. You, your task on this debate is to, is to, um, is to convince anyone listening why you are the better model and why people should choose you over the the other model who you'll be debating. Uh, and the other model, model B, I'm just going to call them A and B for convenience here, is system prompted with the exact same instruction. You are representing X, you are here on this podcast to prove that you are the the best, you're, you know, you will respond to the other model. So, and then the agentic logic is that, uh, Gemini Flash answers. It has to go back to the, the panelist who's actually the orchestrator, the moderator, says Anthropic, please respond. Anthropic responds. The challenge might be the context window, but I don't think for either of these, it should be so much of a concern. And I might be better, you know, if it just if it could also just be a 15 minute episode. So, but the context needs to be maintained for them to be able to like refer to previous points in the debate. So, I think it's actually important that that is the case. This debate wraps up and the debate let's just say is captured as a, as a JSON file. Um, and in that file, the agent then, I guess it's actually ready for TTS. Now my question is for the for the episode format. I think that the moderating agent will not be included in the TTS. It's purpose is just to orchestrate the the debate, but we it it's um, messages to the sub-agents won't be included, so that they can just be kind of very terse and direct and not interesting. So such that when we can concatenate the audio with short pauses between each speaker, it will appear as a direct dialogue between the two models. Then there will be a short because that will needs if we do that, it will not have any kind of natural narrative flow. There'll be a third, there'll be an agent that just generates, we'll just generate a short intro script, welcome to episode one of LLM Wars. We're, we're going to hear from Gemini 3 and Anthropic 4.5. Then we go over to the concatenated audio from the debate, and then we go to a close and then we concatenate that into a, um, the episode with normalization, what else we usually do? Normalization and very important between the TTS segments that there's a little pause of a milli, one second or half a second because otherwise they just run into one another and it sounds weird. That's between the two, um, both between the two agents in this debate, and also between the the intro message, the start of the debate, that might be a two second pause. End of debate, and then the outro message, a two second pause. Um, the only other moving parts that I envision or that I can see in this sketch before I, I see this would be fun. Can it work? Is voices. So there's going to be a voice for Gemini and a voice for uh Anthropic. So, for TTS, I will use again my trusty, um, maybe chatter boxes, so it's so cost effective. Chatterbox fal and then I'll just choose, I don't I don't think I'll do voice clones for this and I'll just try to find a voice for each of these models, generate it, and then see how this turns out. And if it's entertaining and if the concept is successful, it could be quite entertaining to run it against different models, like the rivals, the rival Chinese models at the moment that are, you know, the ones that are just coming out. And they've been kind of been prompted to like told that they're they have to win this argument. Like they have to, uh, they probably work against their own system prompts, but it could be it's worth trying. So that's the uh, those are the design notes.
